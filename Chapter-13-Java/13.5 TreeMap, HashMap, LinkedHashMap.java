/**
 *  HashMap offers O(1) lookup and insertion;   ordering of the keys is essentially arbitrary;  
 *      HashMap is implemented by an array pf linked list.
 *
 *  TreeMap offers O(logN) lookup and insertion;    Keys are in sorted order, it must implement the Comparable interface;
 *      TreeMap is implemented by a Red-Black Tree.
 *  
 *  LinkedHashMap offers O(1) lookup and insertion; Keys are ordered by their insertion order;
 *      LinkedHashMap is implemented by doubly-linked buckets.
