/**
 *  Process:
 *  As an instance of a program in execution. A process is an independent entity to which system resources (e.g., CPU time  and memory)
 *  are allocated.
 *  Each process is executed in a separate address space, and one process cannot access the variables and data structures of another 
 *  process.
 *  If a process wishes to access another process` resources, inter-process communications have to be used.
